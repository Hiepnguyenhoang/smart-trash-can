# Smart Trash Bin Program

The Smart Trash Bin program was developed by Nguyen Hoang Hiep - 20213703. Its function is to automatically open the trash bin lid using a servo motor when someone approaches.

## Hardware requirements
- Arduino Uno R3
- Ultrasonic HC-SR04
- Servo SG90

## Wiring Components
### Connecting HC-SR04 to Arduino
- VCC = 5V  # Arduino
- Trig = 13 # Arduino
- Echo = 12 # Arduino
- GND = GND # Arduino

### Connecting servo SG90 to Arduino
- VCC = 3.3V (hoặc 5V) # Arduino
- GND = GND            # Arduino
- servo_pin = 11       # Arduino

## How to run
To run the program, download the file and upload it to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
